# Things that are good to have in mind

* Mistakes = Learning!
* Not knowing stuff is normal, the pros spend half their day googling for solutions
* Start with small steps, iterate over them and upgrade on every iteration
* Don't Panic!

# What is programming

# What is a programming language?
* Bunch of rules which may control a computer
* They are similar to the natural languages but are with stricter rules

# What is code?
* Code is text written in a programming language
* Sequence of commands and data
* When we write code, we communicate

![pc-vs-human](pc_vs_human.jpg)

# Some of the programming languages

![uses-of-programming-languages](prog_languages.jpg)

# Different types of applications

* Application = A type of software that enables the user to perform different tasks
* Different types of applications exist (web apps, mobile apps...)

# Which programming language shall I learn

# Web development

# Web development Dictionary

* Web Server = A Web server is a computer system that hosts websites
* Client = The Browser
* Domain name = Website's address on the world wide web
* User Interface (UI) =  The screens and interactive touchpoints that make up a website or an app
* User eXperience (UX) = All about providing a smooth, user-friendly experience for the end user as they navigate around a website or an app

![client-server](client-server.png)

#### A great resource to learn more: https://dusk.geo.orst.edu/gis/Google_Book_20Things.pdf

# Types of websites

* Static - always the same. if you want to make changes to its content, you do it in the code. you do not need logic and can be done by using just HTML and CSS
* Dynamic - Shablons, filled with data from the User interface, there may be interaction with the user. Needs logic with collects and aggregates the data if needed (example: a CMS)
* What we are going to do today falls in the first category

# In HTML we trust!

# Text documents VS text editors

* Programs that are designed to edit plain text
* Word documents are not text files! (you can think of Word for text is like Photoshop for an image)
* Some text editors offer additional helpful features such as automatically coloring the various special commands

# How to make file extensions visible if they are not

* Windows: https://www.google.bg/search?q=windows+7+show+extensions+for+known+file+types
* Mac OS X: https://support.apple.com/bg-bg/guide/mac-help/mchlp2304/mac

# The building blocks of a web page

* HTML - the structure of the document
* CSS - the presentation of the document
* JavaScript - adds sophisticated functionality

![html-css](html-css-example.jpg)

# HTML

* Not a programming language
* Markdown language for creating Web pages
* Tells browsers how to lay out and present content on a web page
* Consists of a series of elements
* Elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

![html-example](html-example.png)

# CSS

* Unlike HTML, which is concerned with the meaning of the content, CSS is presentational: it's concerned with how that content should look
* Not a programming language
* Evolution of a web page: https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/
* Play around with http://www.csszengarden.com/

![css-illustrated by Christoph Niemann](css-beauty.png)

# Show time!
![hello-world](hello-world.jpg)

# Let's get our hands dirty
* Fire up your text editor
* Create a HTML document
* Type "Hello World" within the HTML document you just created
* Save the file someplace you'll be able to find easily, like your Desktop

![hello-world-file](1.png)

PS: After the workshop you can go through a more detailed guide here: http://docs.railsbridge.org/frontend/introduction_to_html

# Open the file in the browser
* Click twice on the file
* Even though your file does not include any HTML tags yet, browsers are great at showing text on screen, so your browser will just show you your text.

![hello-world-browser](2.png)

# First tag!

* Update the contents of your hello.html file to look like this

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
Hello <i>World</i>!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Save the file and refresh the browser

![hello-world-italic](3.png)

# HTML is Tags

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opening tag: <i>
Content: world
Closing tag: </i>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### All these things combined are called an HTML element:

# Let's introduce ourselves

* On a new line introduce yourself

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
Hello <i>World</i>!
My name is Sophia!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Save the file and refresh the browser

![introduction](4.png)

# Let's add structure

* Lets update our first row with <strong>header 1</strong> tag and our introduction to be in <strong>paragraph</strong> tag

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<h1>Hello <i>World</i>!</h1>
<p>My name is Sophia!</p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* It's common for an HTML tag to be nested inside another tag
* Save the file and refresh the browser

![introduction-structured](5.png)

# Tags for Every Occasion
##### You don't need to memorize all the tags! You can always look them up on sites like

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element

# Pages, Like People, Have a Head and a Body

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<head>
  <!-- Important invisible details will go here! -->
</head>
<body>
  Visible Content
</body>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The Head
#### Contains information that is not displayed directly but influences the page
#### Examples:
* What the page title should be:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<title>My awesome page!</title>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* What CSS and JavaScript files to include (and where they are):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# The Body

* The actual content of your file.
* The things you'll want your users to be able to see, read, or interact with.
* Until now we were writing content for our body

# Let's add head and body to our file

* In addition to the <strong>head</strong> and <strong>body</strong> tags the whole code should be in a <strong>html</strong> tag in order the file to be valid.
* Let's add the html, head, and body tags to our index.html file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello <i>World</i>!</h1>
    <p>My name is Sophia!</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Who likes bureaucracy...

#### One more final step separates us from the valid file

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<!DOCTYPE html>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* It tells the browser which version of HTML you're using
* It should stay on top of all the code

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello <i>World</i>!</h1>
    <p>My name is Sophia!</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Let's add a bit of style

#### CSS Rules Are Made of a Selector and Attributes

![introduction](6.png)

# Style tags

* We're going to add our CSS inside the <strong>head</strong> tag
* This is not a good practice and it is preferred that a separate css file is created

#### A style tag looks like this

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<style type="text/css" media="screen"></style>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### And the whole code update with the style tag:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style type="text/css" media="screen">
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello <i>World</i>!</h1>
    <p>My name is Sophia!</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Let's add CSS... finally

#### CSS code looks like

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
p {
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #ffefd5;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### And we are going to add it in the style tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style type="text/css" media="screen">
      p {
        padding: 10px;
        background-color: #ffefd5;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello <i>World</i>!</h1>
    <p>My name is Sophia!</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Congrats! We are ready with our website!

# Let's celebrate by putting it online where everyone can access it!

* Create a repository in GitHub: https://github.com/new
* name your repository: <strong>yourgithubusername</strong>.github.io
